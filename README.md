Frontend Cheat Sheet is a combination of several different things. It is a portfolio project that will collect all of my different frontend tricks, and publish them to one site. It serves as a skeleton for a new project, and a reference for myself. It collects my personal custom hooks, showcases my design skills, and serves as a source of snippets for everyday use.

Please note that this project is still in development, and is not yet ready for production. Also, several components are meant to show design only, and the way that state, props, security and other things are handled are far from optimal. The password you create on the first page is stored in plaintext in Redux. Please don't use your real password, especially if you only use one password for everything.

Run npm install to install all dependencies.
Tinker away.
Hire me and my company to build your next project.
